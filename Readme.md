<h1>Design Patterns</h1>
<p>Creational is about instantiation, and Structural is the blueprint, then Behavioral is the pattern of the relationship. </p>
</br>
<h2>Behavioural Patterns</h2>
<p>Patterns where strategy of object collaboration and the delegation of responsibilities among objects is used as means of problem solving.</p>
</br>
<h2>Structural Patterns</h2>
<p>Patterns where strategy is focussed around relationships among entities are classified under Structural Design Patterns.</p>
</br>
<h2>Creational Patterns</h2>
<p>Patterns where strategy is driven around object instantiation process are classified under Creational Patterns.</p>
</br>
<h2>Architectural Patterns</h2>
<p>
<ul><li>Model-View-Controller (MVC): Separates the application logic into three interconnected components: model, view, and controller.</li>
<li>Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM): Separates the user interface into three components: model, view, and view-model.</li>
<li>Repository: Mediates between the data source and the business logic, providing a consistent interface for accessing and manipulating data.</li></ul>
  </p>
 </br>
  <h2>Concurrency Patterns</h2>
  <p>
  <ul><li>Producer-Consumer: Coordinates the flow of data between producer and consumer threads.</li>
    <li>Mutex: Provides mutual exclusion to protect shared resources from concurrent access.</li>
    <li>Read-Write Lock: Allows multiple readers or a single writer to access a shared resource.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
 </br>
<h2>Integration Patterns</h2>
<p><ul><li>Publish-Subscribe: Decouples the sender (publisher) from the receiver (subscriber) by introducing an intermediary (message broker).</li>
  <li>Request-Reply: Involves sending a request message and receiving a correlated reply message.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h1>Decorator Pattern</h1>
<p> When the develoment goal is to add a new behavior to given class's instance dynamically without affecting other instances. We use Decorator Pattern for such usecases.
Putting it in another way, the decorator pattern provides us with a way to modify the behaviour of individual objects without necessity to create new derived class.
We use decorator pattern where object containment is favoured over object inheritence.</p>

<h1> Facade Pattern </h1> 
<p> Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern adds an interface to existing system to hide its complexities.

This pattern involves a single class which provides simplified methods required by client and delegates calls to methods of existing system classes. </p>

<h1> Flyweight Pattern </h1> 
<p> Flyweight pattern is primarily used to reduce the number of objects created and to decrease memory footprint and increase performance. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern provides ways to decrease object count thus improving the object structure of application. Flyweight pattern tries to reuse already existing similar kind objects by storing them and creates new object when no matching object is found. </p>

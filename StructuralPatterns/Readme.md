<h1>Decorator Pattern</h1>
<p> When the develoment goal is to add a new behavior to given class's instance dynamically without affecting other instances. We use Decorator Pattern for such usecases.
Putting it in another way, the decorator pattern provides us with a way to modify the behaviour of individual objects without necessity to create new derived class.
We use decorator pattern where object containment is favoured over object inheritence.</p>

<h2>Builder Pattern</h2>
<p>This is an extension of factory pattern but similar to it. Based on the data we try to return an collection of objects rather then an object. In other words pattern which used factory methods to create objects without having to specify the type of objects to be created.</p>

<h2>Singleton Pattern</h2>
<p>The singleton design pattern is used to restrict the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the JVM. In other words, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time per JVM instance.</p>

<h1>Memento Design Pattern</h1>
<p>There are three entities involved, a.Originator b. Memento c. Caretaker
Originator is the application in context for which we take a snapshot. The snapshot taken on Originator is called “memento”. All these operations taken on “Originator” like taking snapshot, storing it and restoring snapshot on to the originator is done by an entity called “Caretaker”.

<h1>Observer Design Pattern
</h1>
<p>The client class will have the list of objects which will have to be notified on an event. Publisher will call the methods which are registered on occurrence of an event. 
</p>

<h1>Strategy Design Pattern</h1>
<p>In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a software design pattern that enables an algorithm’s behavior to be selected at runtime. 
The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.

<h1>Memento Design Pattern</h1>
<p>There are three entities involved, a.Originator b. Memento c. Caretaker
Originator is the application in context for which we take a snapshot. The snapshot taken on Originator is called “memento”. All these operations taken on “Originator” like taking snapshot, storing it and restoring snapshot on to the originator is done by an entity called “Caretaker”.
